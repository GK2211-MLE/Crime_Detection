Project focused on image classification for crime detection using the UCF Crime dataset. This dataset encompasses 14 classes, including Abuse, Arrest, Arson, Assault, Burglary, Explosion, Fighting, Normal Videos, Road Accidents, Robbery, Shooting, Shoplifting, Stealing, and Vandalism. Our approach involves employing deep learning techniques and transfer learning models like Xception, VGG16, InceptionV3, MobileNet, and DenseNet121 to enhance accuracy and contribute to a safer society.
